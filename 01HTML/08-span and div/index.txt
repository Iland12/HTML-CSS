Definition:
<div> (division): A block-level container used to group 
larger sections of HTML (like multiple paragraphs, headings, 
or images).

<span>: An inline container used to apply styles or scripts to 
part of the text within a line.

They don't affect the content visually unless styled 
with CSS - they exist for grouping and structure.
