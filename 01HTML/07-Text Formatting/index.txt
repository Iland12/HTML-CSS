Definition:
Text formatting tags in HTML are used to style or 
emphasize text - such as making it bold, italic, 
underlined, or marked .Some tags also convey 
semantic meaning, which is important for accessibility 
and SEO (Search Engine Optimization).



Common Text Formatting Tags:
Tags				Purpose					Semantic?
<b>				Bold (visual only)				❌
<strong>		Important text (bold)			✅
<i>				Italic (visual only)			❌
<em>			Emphasized text (italic)		✅
<u>				Underlined text					❌
<mark>			Highlight text					✅
<small>			Smaller text					✅
<del>			Deleted/Strikethrough text		✅
<ins>			Inserted/underlined text		✅
<sub>			Subscript text					✅
<sup>			Superscript text				✅


## Semantic tags tell the browser and screen readers 
the purpose of the text (eg. <strong>)
## Non-Semantic tags just change how it 
looks (eg. <b>)
